# coffee_machine
My first Python project. A coffee machine made along the JetBrains Academy course.
My code can be found under coffee_machine/PycharmProjects/Coffee Machine/Coffee Machine/task/machine/.
For future JetBrains projects, I will do the project in my own seperate project to avoid this mess.

### update
This project, as well as two others are on a new repository entitled "beginner_projects".
It's a lot easier to navigate than this, but doesn't have any of the tests or problems I solved here. I will keep this repository up as it was the first
one I ever created, but go to the other one.
